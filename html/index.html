    <h1>Hey! An command line Interruption Tracker</h1>
    <p class="LemonYellowSun">
      "Hey! I've got a question."
      <br />"Hey can you take a look at this?"
      <br />"Hey, did you finish that thing?"
      <br />"Hey!"
    </p>

    <h2>Sound familiar?</h2>
    <p>
Interested in tracking just how many times you're interrupted and by who?
    </p>

    <p>Well hey, maybe <span class="LemonYellowSun">Hey!</span> is the tool for 
    you.</p>

    <p>When someone walks up to you and starts talking, breaks your concentration with
yet another slack message, or diety forbid, actually calls your phone...just
type <code>hey &lt;person's name&gt;</code> on the command line.
	</p>

	<p>That's it. An entry in a local db will be created for the event, who did
	it, and when it happened.</p>

    <p>Want to start tracking _why_ people are interrupting you? After the interruption 
you can, optionally, list and tag the events, leave a note, 
or generate reports graphing all your past interruptions.</p>

    <p>Track it for long enough and patterns are sure to emerge. Maybe you'll find 
that a little documentation could save you hours a week. Maybe you'll find that
one person that's devouring more time than anyone else and discuss a better way to
handle things.</p>

    <h2>Reports</h2>
    <p>One of the more interesting things about hey is that you are not limited
    to the reports I've created. You can add as many reports as you want in any
    language you want. They can generate, HTML, PDFs, whatever output you want.
    You can find details on the <a href="creating_reports.html">Creating
    Reports</a> page.</p>

    <p>To see what reports are available just type 
    <code>hey report</code></p>

    <p>Hey ships with 3 command line reports:
    <ul>
      <li><b>people_overview</b>
      <br />Generates a table with all the people you've interacted with, their recent activity, and tags.</li>
      <li><b>interrupts_by_hour</b>
      <br />Generates a graph of interruptions by hour</li>
      <li><b>sparkline_24</b>
      <br />generates a small sparkline graph of interruptions within the past 24 hours. Useful for integrating into other command line things, like your prompt.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>Please check out the <a href="usage.html">Usage page</a> for usage
    details.</p>
    
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <h3>Mac Users</h3>
    <p><a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> is the best way to install it on the Mac.
    <code>
    $ brew tap masukomi/homebrew-apps
    $ brew install hey
    </code>

    <h3>Geeks On Other Platforms</h3>
    <p>You'll need to build Hey! from source. It is written in 
    <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a> so you'll need to install
    the crystal compiler. After that you just clone down this repository, cd 
    into it and run 

    <code>
    ./build.sh
    </code>
